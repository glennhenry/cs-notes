description: Computer & Programming Fundamentals Notes
---

These topics serve as an introduction to a more advanced and specific topics, it also contains fundamental terminology or technique used in computer science and programming.

:::note
Although the topic seems introductory, it actually assumes certain programming knowledge. Anyway, this is essentially just a note, which mean I already know them beforehand.
