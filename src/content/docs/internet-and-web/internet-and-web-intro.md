In terms of developing web, it is typically divided into two aspects.

- **Frontend**: Frontend relates to any visual elements, such as the user interface and experience of website for web application. Developers use tools like [HTML](/cs-notes/internet-and-web/html), [CSS](/cs-notes/internet-and-web/css), and [JavaScript](/cs-notes/internet-and-web/javascript) to create the visual and interactive elements of a website that users see and interact with in their [web browsers](/cs-notes/internet-and-web/web-browser).
- **Backend**: Backend is not exclusive to web development. Any application that require server intervention will need a backend application. Things that need server includes finding or storing data on [the cloud](/cs-notes/cloud-computing-and-distributed-systems-intro), doing complex calculation that local computers won't be able to do, etc. A backend app is not mandatory to develop a website, but is often present these days. In addition, the backend app doesn't have to be developed on our own. We can instead use others backend app, which we will tell the browser through code how to talk to it.

This topic doesn't explain the development aspect but rather focuses on what is involved on the internet and the web.

:::info
A web app without a backend is often called a static page, which requires us to download only the webpage.
