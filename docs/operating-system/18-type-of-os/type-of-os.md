There are many types of OSes :

- **Single-User or Multi-User** : Single-user OS are designed to support and cater to the needs of a single user at a time. All resource such as storage are dedicated to the individual user. Examples are MS-DOS, Windows 3x, Windows 95, Macintosh OS.

  Multi-user OS allow multiple users to access the computer, it typically includes mechanism like permission and authentication for securing shared resources. Examples are Linux based OS, macOS, Windows.

- **Single-Tasking or Multitasking** : Single-tasking operating systems can only execute one task or process at a time. When a program is running, the entire system's resources are dedicated to that particular task until it completes or is interrupted. Examples are MS-DOS and earlier versions of Macintosh OS.

  Multitasking operating systems are designed to run multiple tasks or processes concurrently. CPU time and other resources is divided fairly among them. Examples are Windows, macOS, and Linux.

- **Real-Time OS (RTOS)** : RTOSs are designed to handle real-time applications and provide guaranteed response times for critical tasks. They are commonly used in embedded systems and industrial applications. Examples are FreeRTOS, QNX, and VxWorks.

- **Network OS (NOS)** : NOSs are specifically designed to manage and coordinate network resources. They enable sharing of files, printers, and other network devices among multiple connected computers. Examples are Novell NetWare and Windows Server.
- **Mobile OS** : These operating systems are designed for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. They focus on touch interfaces, power management, and mobile-specific features. Examples are Android, iOS, and Windows Phone.
- **Distributed OS** : Distributed operating systems run on multiple machines and coordinate their activities to appear as a single unified system. They are used in clusters, cloud computing, and distributed computing environments. Examples include Google's Chrome OS and Amoeba.
- **Embedded OS** : Embedded operating systems are designed to run on embedded systems with limited resources, such as microcontrollers or IoT devices. They are typically lightweight, compact, and tailored for specific hardware platforms. Examples are Embedded Linux, and ThreadX.
- **Virtualization OS** : These operating systems provide [virtualization](/cloud-computing-and-distributed-systems/virtualization) capabilities to enable multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical machine. Examples include VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and Xen.
