Type of OS page

Single-User, Single-Tasking: These operating systems are designed to support a single user and can execute only one task at a time. Examples include early versions of MS-DOS.

Single-User, Multi-Tasking: These operating systems allow a single user to run multiple tasks or applications simultaneously. Examples include Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Multi-User: Multi-user operating systems are designed to support multiple users concurrently. Each user can have their own login credentials and run multiple tasks or applications independently. Examples include UNIX, Linux, and server versions of Windows.

Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS): RTOSs are designed to handle real-time applications and provide guaranteed response times for critical tasks. They are commonly used in embedded systems and industrial applications. Examples include FreeRTOS, QNX, and VxWorks.

Network Operating Systems (NOS): NOSs are specifically designed to manage and coordinate network resources. They enable sharing of files, printers, and other network devices among multiple connected computers. Examples include Novell NetWare and Windows Server.

Mobile Operating Systems: These operating systems are designed for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. They focus on touch interfaces, power management, and mobile-specific features. Examples include Android, iOS, and Windows Phone.

Distributed Operating Systems: Distributed operating systems run on multiple machines and coordinate their activities to appear as a single unified system. They are used in clusters, cloud computing, and distributed computing environments. Examples include Google's Chrome OS and Amoeba.

Embedded Operating Systems: Embedded operating systems are designed to run on embedded systems with limited resources, such as microcontrollers or IoT devices. They are typically lightweight, compact, and tailored for specific hardware platforms. Examples include FreeRTOS, Embedded Linux, and ThreadX.

Virtualization Operating Systems: These operating systems provide virtualization capabilities to enable multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical machine. Examples include VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and Xen.
