The web is often categorized into 3 based on the accessibility and visibility of websites and online content : surface web, deep web, and dark web.

### Surface Web

The surface web refers to any part of the internet that can be accessed through search engines like Google, Bing, or Yahoo. This includes websites and online services that are publicly accessible and can be found using standard web browsers.

### Deep Web VS Dark Web

Deep web and dark web is often used interchangeably, they both related to part of the internet that is not indexed by search engines but differs in the content they offer.

#### Deep Web

The deep web refers to any part of the internet that is not indexed by search engines and is therefore inaccessible through a simple Google search. This includes things like private databases, academic research, government and military networks, and other content that is not intended for public consumption.

#### Dark Web

Dark web on the other hand is a small part of the deep web that is intentionally hidden and requires specific software such as [Tor Browser](/extras/tor-browser) and configurations to access. It contains websites and online services that are intentionally hidden and operate anonymously, often used for illegal activities such as the sale of drugs, weapons, and stolen information.

### History of Dark Web

The dark web originated in the early 2000s as a way for government agencies, particularly the US Navy, to communicate securely and anonymously online. The technology used to create the dark web was called [TOR (The Onion Router)](/extras/tor-browser), which is a free, open-source software that allows users to browse the internet anonymously by encrypting their traffic and routing it through a network of servers around the world.

TOR was later released to the public, and over time, the dark web became a haven for people seeking anonymity online. It quickly became associated with illegal activities, such as drug sales, arms trafficking, and the sale of stolen information like credit card numbers and personal data.
