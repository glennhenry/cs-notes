# CS Notes

My Computer Science notes from various online courses, tutorial, and lectures. I wanted to make my notes into a documentation-style layout to improve the overall readability and presentation.

\* Most of the topics covers more on the theoretical side and less on the technical side.

### All topics

- **[Digital Signal Processing](digital-signal-processing)**
- **[Computer & Programming Fundamentals](computer-and-programming-fundamentals)**
- **[Digital Media Processing](digital-media-processing)**
- **[Computer Networking](computer-networking)**
- [Data Structures & Algorithms](data-structures-and-algorithms)
- [Computer Organization & Architecture](computer-organization-and-architecture)
- [Operating System](operating-system)
- [Theory of Computation & Automata](theory-of-computation-and-automata)
- [Compilers](compilers)
- [Programming Language Theory](programming-language-theory)
- [System Programming](system-programming)
- [Database System](database-system)
- **[Computer Graphics](computer-graphics)**
- **[Frontend Web Development](frontend-web-development)**
- **[Backend Development](backend-development)**
- [Computer Security](computer-security)
- **[Machine Learning](machine-learning)**
- **[Deep Learning](deep-learning)**
- [Software Engineering](software-engineering)
- [Cloud Computing](cloud-computing)
- [Extras](extras)

\*Bolded are completed

#### TODO :

- **[add]** : add new notes
- **[update]** : update existing notes
- **[edit]** : edit notes
- **[ref]** : add reference to particular notes

1. **[add]** extras/tor-browser
2. **[update]** frontend-web-development/search-engine#crawler
3. **[add]** extras/wayback-machine
4. **[update]** computer-graphics/computer-display#buffer (explain frame buffer, back buffer, how they are used)
5. **[update]** computer-graphics/computer-display#vsync
6. **[update]** digital-signal-processing/compression#svd-compression
7. **[ref]** backend-development/search-engine#elasticsearch (ref to document database)
8. **[ref]** backend-development/serverless (ref to FaaS cloud computing)
9. **[add]** extras/torrent (BitTorrent protocol)
10. **[ref]** backend-development/caching (cache invalidation ref to database trigger)
11. **[ref]** backend-development/backend-optimization (resource optimization ref to database index)
12. **[add]** extras/url-shortener
13. **[update]** backend-development/websocket#data-exchange : add web socket payload, frame, ping, pong, fin, rsv, close, timeout
14. **[update]** computer-graphics/low-level-graphics : add the line drawing algorithm, we can never draw a perfect line, it can be ambiguous, which pixel should be determined to draw. Text rendering
15. **[ref]** /computer-and-programming-fundamentals/data-representation (refer to database)
16. **[ref]** /computer-and-programming-fundamentals/query-language (refer to concepts in database system)
17. **[ref]** /computer-and-programming-fundamentals/concurrency-and-parallelism (refer to operating system IPC)
18. **[add]** /digital-media-processing/iso (ISO file format, how they work)
19. **[update]** computer-graphics (should be major updated. Rewrite most of the notes due to lack of detail, lack of more important topic, and bad English)
20. **[ref]** /data-structures-and-algorithms/complexity-theory (ref to Turing machine and other TOC related terms)
