# CS Notes

My Computer Science notes from various online courses, tutorial, and lectures. I wanted to make my notes into a documentation-style layout to improve the overall readability and presentation.

\* Most of the topics covers more on the theoretical side and less on the technical side.

### All topics

- [Digital Signal Processing](digital-signal-processing)
- [Digital Media Processing](digital-media-processing)
- [Computer Networking](computer-networking)
- [Data Structures & Algorithms](data-structures-and-algorithms)
- [Software Engineering](software-engineering)
- [Web Development](web-development)
- [Backend Development](backend-development)
- [Computer Security](computer-security)
- [Computer Graphics](computer-graphics)
- [Data Science](data-science)
- [Machine Learning](machine-learning)
- [Deep Learning](deep-learning)
- [Cloud Computing](cloud-computing)
- [Extras](extras)

TODO :

1. Virtualization operating system and cloud computing (probably will be the same notes) (virtualbox as example)
2. OGG Vorbis should refer to cryptography or cybersecurity hash function
3. Text File (txt) should refer to UTF-8 somewhere
4. PDF maybe? refer to AES encryption in crpytography or cybersecurity
5. IP Address maybe refer to binary format and hexadecimal somewhere
6. subnet mask maybe refer to bitwise operation AND
7. HTTP/HTTPS refer to eavesdropping, man in the middle attack in computer security and key exchange (symmetric + asymmetric + diffie hellman + rsa) in computer security-cryptography
8. wifi refer to eavesdropping in computer security

### Credits

#### Site Generator

- This site is made using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) an open source static site generator made by Meta with React.

#### AI Chatbot Software

- Assisted with few AI tools [Sage Poe](https://poe.com), [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), [Bard](https://bard.google.com/). **Most of the source here are are also from AI**. I combined what the resources says with extra explanation from AI bots.

#### Online Courses and Media Source

- Various online resource were used in the creation of this site, I try to include all resource in each section. These resource act as the curriculum of what should I learn and the structure of what a topic contains. 

#### Additional Resources

- [GitHub](https://github.com/) - For storing and hosting this site.
