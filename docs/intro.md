# CS Notes

My Computer Science notes from various online courses, tutorial, and lectures. I wanted to make my notes into a documentation-like layout to improve the overall readability and presentation.

**Most of the topics covers more on the theoretical side and less on the technical side.**

### All topics

- **[Digital Signal Processing](digital-signal-processing)**
- **[Computer & Programming Fundamentals](computer-and-programming-fundamentals)**
- **[Digital Media Processing](digital-media-processing)**
- **[Computer Networking](computer-networking)**
- **[Data Structures & Algorithms](data-structures-and-algorithms)**
- **[Computer Organization & Architecture](computer-organization-and-architecture)**
- [Operating System](operating-system)
- [Theory of Computation & Automata](theory-of-computation-and-automata)
- [Compilers](compilers)
- [Programming Language Theory](programming-language-theory)
- [Database System](database-system)
- **[Computer Graphics](computer-graphics)**
- **[Frontend Web Development](frontend-web-development)**
- **[Backend Development](backend-development)**
- **[Computer Security](computer-security)**
- **[Machine Learning](machine-learning)**
- **[Deep Learning](deep-learning)**
- [Software Engineering](software-engineering)
- [Cloud Computing](cloud-computing)

\*Bolded are completed

#### TODO :

- **[add]** : add new notes
- **[update]** : update existing notes
- **[ref]** : add reference to particular notes

1. **[update]** computer-graphics : Should be major updated. Rewrite most of the notes due to lack of detail, lack of more important topic. Some topic to include :

   - Frame buffer, back buffer, vsync.
   - Primitive rendering, text rendering.

2. **[update]** frontend-web-development : Minor update for all note, also some topic to include for addition :

   - Search engine, crawler.

3. **[update]** Fix English and typo from each note of topics :

   - Computer Graphics
   - Frontend Web Development
   - Digital Signal Processing
   - Digital Media Processing
   - Computer Networking
   - Machine Learning
   - Deep Learning
   - Backend Development

4. **[update]** digital-signal-processing : /compression#svd-compression -> add svd compression.
5. **[add]** /digital-media-processing : /iso -> add ISO file format.
6. **[update]** backend-development : /websocket -> #data-exchange, add web socket payload, frame, ping, pong, fin, rsv, close, timeout.
7. **[ref]** backend-development : /search-engine#elasticsearch -> ref to document database.
8. **[ref]** backend-development : /serverless -> ref to FaaS in Cloud Computing.
9. **[ref]** backend-development : /caching#cache-invalidation -> ref to database trigger.
10. **[ref]** backend-development : /backend-optimization#resource-optimization -> ref to database index.
11. **[ref]** /computer-and-programming-fundamentals : /data-representation -> ref to database.
12. **[ref]** /computer-and-programming-fundamentals : /query-language -> ref to few concepts in database system.
13. **[ref]** /data-structures-and-algorithms : /complexity-theory -> ref to Turing machine and other TOC related terms.
14. **[ref]** /computer-security : /reverse-engineering -> ref to decompilation in compilers.
15. **[ref]** /operating-system : /virtualization -> ref to distributed systems in cloud-computing.
16. **[ref]** /operating-system : /os-fundamentals -> ref to distributed systems in cloud-computing.

#### Site Generator

- This site is made using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) an open source static site generator made by Meta with React.

#### AI Chatbot Software

- Assisted with few AI tools [Assistant Poe](https://poe.com), [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), [Bard](https://bard.google.com/). **Most of the source here are also from AI**. I combined what the resources say with extra explanation from AI bots (or paraphrasing).

#### Online Courses and Media Source

- Various online resource were used in the creation of this site, I try to include all resource in each section. These resources act as the curriculum of what should I learn and the structure of what a topic contains.
