# CS Notes

My Computer Science notes from various online courses, tutorial, and lectures. I wanted to make my notes into a documentation-style layout to improve the overall readability and presentation.

\* Most of the topics covers more on the theoretical side and less on the technical side.

### All topics

- **[Digital Signal Processing](digital-signal-processing)**
- [Computer & Programming Fundamentals](computer-and-programming-fundamentals)
- **[Digital Media Processing](digital-media-processing)**
- **[Computer Networking](computer-networking)**
- [Data Structures & Algorithms](data-structures-and-algorithms)
- [Computer Organization & Architecture](computer-organization-and-architecture)
- [Operating System](operating-system)
- [Theory of Computation & Automata](theory-of-computation-and-automata)
- [Compilers](compilers)
- [Programming Language Theory](programming-language-theory)
- [System Programming](system-programming)
- [Database System](database-system)
- **[Computer Graphics](computer-graphics)**
- **[Frontend Web Development](frontend-web-development)**
- [Backend Development](backend-development)
- [Computer Security](computer-security)
- **[Machine Learning](machine-learning)**
- [Deep Learning](deep-learning)
- [Software Engineering](software-engineering)
- [Cloud Computing](cloud-computing)
- [Extras](extras)

\*Bolded : completed

#### Site Generator

- This site is made using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) an open source static site generator made by Meta with React.

#### AI Chatbot Software

- Assisted with few AI tools [Sage Poe](https://poe.com), [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), [Bard](https://bard.google.com/). **Most of the source here are are also from AI**. I combined what the resources says with extra explanation from AI bots.

#### Online Courses and Media Source

- Various online resource were used in the creation of this site, I try to include all resource in each section. These resource act as the curriculum of what should I learn and the structure of what a topic contains.

#### Additional Resources
