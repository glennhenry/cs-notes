**Reinforcement Learning (RL)** is

Deep RL

### The Big Idea

- Markov Models
- Markov Decision
- Value & Policy Iteration
- Q-Learning
- Temporal Difference
- Model-Free Prediction (Monte Carlo Methods)
- Model-Free Control (SARSA)
- Model-Based
- Bandits (Multi-armed, contextual)
- Policy Gradient
- Actor-Critic
- Exploration
