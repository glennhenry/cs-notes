The entire diffusion topics is based on the fast.ai part 2 course, with addition from other sources.

**Diffusion Model** is ...

this note should include the general principle of how diffusion model works, the next notes should explain it in more detailed along with the explanation about the method and technique used.
  
what to explain in diffusion :
- Diffusion method
- Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)
- Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM)
- conditional and unconditional diffusion
- sampler
- a
- b
- c
the last 3: stable diffusion, dall-e, and midjourney will explain what diffusion model technique they specifically uses, it can be thought as the application of diffusion model.
- stable diffusion
- dall-e
- midjourney
