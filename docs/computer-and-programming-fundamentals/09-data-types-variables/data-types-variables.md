Data Types & Variables

Here is an example in code :

```
a = 5
a = 3
```
When we assign `a = 5`, a memory object representing the value `5` is created and stored. The variable `a` is then associated with this object. Later, when we assign `a = 3`, assuming numbers are immutable, a new memory object representing the value `3` is created. The variable `a` is updated to reference this new object. The original object representing `5` remains in memory until it is cleaned up by the [garbage collector](/computer-and-programming-fundamentals/memory#garbage-collection) or manually released in lower-level programming languages.
