title: Computer & Programming Fundamentals
description: Computer & Programming Fundamentals Notes
---

These topics serve as an introduction to a more advanced and specific topics, it also contains fundamental terminology or technique used in computer science and programming.

:::note
Some explanations are not beginner-friendly.  
Explanation such as programming concepts are hard to explain for me, because I already know them beforehand, making me not cautious if the explanation is simple enough or not. Another reason is because some concept relates to other concept in other topic, making it harder to explain.
