**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the process of programming or developing a system so computers is able to do tasks that typically require human intelligence. **Machine Learning (ML)** is a subfield of AI that specifically makes them learn by themselves from experience or data.

This notes will include explanation about traditional ML algorithms. In each pages, (hopefully) there will be an implementation of the algorithm from scratch. It's actually not from 0, it uses tools but the tools used depends on the complexity of the algorithm.
