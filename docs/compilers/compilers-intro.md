### Temporary

Source code typically need an entry point, which acts as the starting point of execution for the program. These entry points are typically called **main function**.

Software is made using human-readable programming languages. The source code needs to be converted into machine-code that can be executed by computers, this converting process is called [compilation](/computer-and-programming-fundamentals/compilation).

A compiled source code can either be an executable program that can be executed directly, or an **object file**. Relocations
