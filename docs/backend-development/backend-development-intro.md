Backend development is the process of creating the server-side component of an application. Server is a specialized computer used to give response to requests from client, in this case the client is an application. Creating server-side component means we are working to make the server able to respond to request. The request can be anything from asking web page resources, asking specific product from an online shop, or saving our information such as notes online.
