### Adobe Photoshop

Adobe Photoshop is a commonly used and popular editing software.

#### Photoshop Layer

Photoshop is a layer-based editing system. Layer can be thought as transparent sheet that are stacked on top of each other. These layer stack are responsible for which layer should be visible first. Each layer in Photoshop has its own properties, such as opacity, blending mode, and effects. In real case, a part of image can be stacked so that the part can be edited individually without affecting others.

Layer can also be used as non-destructive editing, this mean we don't modify the original image at all, instead we just add layer on top of it. This way we can undo a changes that has been made

#### Example of Changing Background

For example, consider a person photo with sky background behind. We can modify the sky to be a space background. We don't want to modify the person, so we will first identify which section belong to the person. Photoshop has tool called "selection tool", it is used to isolate specific areas or objects within an image.

After isolating it, we can move it to another layer. By separating it to the background layer, we can change the background with a blue color and put the person layer again.
