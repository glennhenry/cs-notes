**Web Development** is the process of building, creating, and maintaining websites and web applications. Web development is typically divided into two : **Frontend Web Development** and **Backend Web Development**.

**Frontend Web Development** is the process of making user interface and experience of website for web application. Developers uses tools like [HTML](frontend-web-development/html), [CSS](frontend-web-development/css), [Javascript](frontend-web-development/javascript) to create the visual and interactive elements of a website that users see and interact with in their [web browsers](frontend-web-development/web-browser).

**Backend Web Development** on the other hand is part of web development that deals with the server-side of web applications such as "server logic and APIs (backend-development/server-logic-and-api)", "database (backend-development/database)".
