We need a medium to transmit signal from sender to receiver in a communication system. Different types of signal transmission media are used depending on the nature of the signals, the distance of transmission, and other factors.

### Type of Transmission Based on Guidance

#### Guided Transmission

Guided transmission refers to the transmission of signals through a physical medium that provides a guided path for the signals to propagate. Guided media includes :

- **Twisted Pair** : Consists of pairs of insulated copper wires twisted together. It is commonly used in Ethernet networks and telephone systems.

- **Coaxial Cable** : Consists of a central conductor, an insulating layer, a metallic shield, and an outer insulating layer. It is used in cable television (CATV) networks and broadband connections.

- **Optical Fiber** : Uses thin strands of glass or plastic fibers to transmit signals as pulses of light by bouncing it between the fibers. It is widely used for high-speed internet connections, long-distance communication, and data center connectivity.

#### Unguided Transmission

Unguided tranmission refers to the transmission of signals through wireless or free space channels where there is no physical medium to guide or confine the signals. Examples of unguided transmission media include electromagnetic waves such as radio, microwaves, and infrared.

For example, radio communication require the transmitter and receiver to be in the same frequency. There are various frequency spectrum in radio waves.

Each region is divided into cells, which are typically represented as hexagons on network planning diagrams. Each cell is served by a base station or cell tower. The purpose of using hexagon, is because they provide flexible shape over the earth.

Light is then bounced from source tower through Ionosphere or satelite to the receiver tower.
