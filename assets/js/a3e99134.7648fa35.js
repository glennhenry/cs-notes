The semi-supervised learning may also involve techniques like pretrained and fine tuning. The pre-trained technique mean the model is trained on unlabeled data. During the pre-training process, the model learns the general language representation and capture how each word relate with each other. It will then be fine tuned, a smaller labeled dataset will be fed to the model to adapt it on specific tasks or specific topic (the method is also called ",(0,r.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"transfer learning"),")."))}u.isMDXComponent=!0},25117:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>a});const a=n.p+"assets/images/add-norm-a83cbb62aef4b9965812c9379658d813.png"},87063:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>a});const a=n.p+"assets/images/encoder-layer-6a205a39c14cf4505b729a703469f5f0.png"},6337:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>a});const a=n.p+"assets/images/masked-multi-head-attention-46ddaaea0aa6d6fd268a3e2ba570cc84.png"},23811:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>a});const a=n.p+"assets/images/multi-head-attention-3944081d5838af9adaaecb5c7beb0abb.png"},81133:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>a});const a=n.p+"assets/images/positional-encoding-45f699c2543499baa834ada806243631.png"},94141:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>a});const a=n.p+"assets/images/self-attention-2-f32b43e6f7b09d16f9cac0f2e824bd1b.png"},9581:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>a});const a=n.p+"assets/images/self-attention-visualization-11a9fbd1c07e6fa7f140ec5827291ab7.png"},85170:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>a});const a=n.p+"assets/images/self-attention-a556567684fdea41975866e764f76c8e.png"},45557:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>a});const a=n.p+"assets/images/transformers-architecture-979b9f67f275bed7004cc50535d25569.png"},92277:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>a});const a=n.p+"assets/images/transformers-output-eda0dc134579527e86a626998bcc2abd.png"}}]);
