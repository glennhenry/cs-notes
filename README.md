I didn't originally intend for this to be public, but since I've hosted it on GitHub Pages, it's now publicly accessible. Feel free to check out my personal [Computer Science notes website](https://glennhenry.github.io/cs-notes/).

website still broken, todo:

- Customize color theme for light/dark mode
- Customize color theme for texts
- customize css
  - border for left and right sidebar
  - border for previous and next page on the bottom.
- Change website position (margin/padding) if needed.
- Fix hyperlinks
- Fix backlinks
- Fix graph not showing
- Enable clickable sidebar groups (allow particular collapse to be able to have its own page).
- Enable breadcrumbs (on top of title).
- change every notes formating to suit with new styling.
